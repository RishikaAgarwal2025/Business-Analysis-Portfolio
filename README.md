### Enhancing Efficiency and Societal Impact of Ahmedabad's BRTS: Interventions and Innovations
**Description:** The study is centered around the analysis of Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) utilization and travel behavior, aiming to simulate and comprehend the impact of BRTS on travel time, duration, and emissions. A comparative evaluation of travel performance and emissions among Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS), private cars, and BRTS is conducted through simulation using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). Policy like parking fee increased, restaurants discounts and carts for better connectivity and for shifting the people from private transportation to public transportation. <br>

**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation, presentations, survey making, survey analysis, simulation modelling <br>
**Hard skills:** MS PowerPoint, SUMO, google forms, SPSS <br>
**Results:** One major worry is the underutilization of BRTS by various income groups, which is attributable to a variety of factors. To address this issue, it is critical to promote gender equity and close the gender gap, as both can lead to higher ridership. Furthermore, increasing ridership would result in increased employment opportunities, income levels, and tax revenues, ultimately contributing to an increase in GDP. Furthermore, the BRTS has the ability to improve air quality by lowering pollution, reducing carbon footprints, and other harmful emissions. Finally, assuring safety by offering free tickets can encourage people to use the BRTS system.
