## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.
### Enhancing Efficiency and Societal Impact of Ahmedabad's BRTS: Interventions and Innovations
**Description:** The study is centered around the analysis of Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) utilization and travel behavior, aiming to simulate and comprehend the impact of BRTS on travel time, duration, and emissions. A comparative evaluation of travel performance and emissions among Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS), private cars, and BRTS is conducted through simulation using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). <br>

  <code>PowerPoint PPTX dynamic version</code></a><br>
**Original dataset:** <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Disseration%20-%20Ahmedabad%20BRTS/Public%20Transportation%20Survey_Data.xlsx">
  <code>public-transportation-survey-data.xlsx</code></a><br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation, presentations, survey making, survey analysis, simulation modelling <br>
**Hard skills:** MS PowerPoint, SUMO, google forms, SPSS <br>
**Results:** One major worry is the underutilization of BRTS by various income groups, which is attributable to a variety of factors. Furthermore, increasing ridership would result in increased employment opportunities, income levels, and tax revenues, ultimately contributing to an increase in GDP. Furthermore, the BRTS has the ability to improve air quality by lowering pollution, reducing carbon footprints, and other harmful emissions. Finally, assuring safety by offering free tickets can encourage people to use the BRTS system.

### Forecasting Tata Motors' Closing Stock Price Using Nifty 50 Data
**Description:** Closing stock price of TATA Motors is predicted using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. For this paper, average of closing price of every year is taken into consideration. The time series observation from 2012 to 2022 is taken. Our main aim is to find the trend from the stock data and also forecast the stock prices for future years. <br>

**Original dataset:** <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20series%20econometrics/Tata_motors_Nifty50.xlsx">
  <code>Tata-motors-nifty50.xlsx</code></a><br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, forecasting <br>
**Hard skills:** Word, Excel, Stata <br>
**Results:** This paper represents a ARIMA model for stock closing price prediction. Through ARIMA model, we forecast the closing prices of stock price of TATA motors for 6 years. Bayesian Information Criterion was used to find the best ARIMA model. Our study was forecasting the stock price and it always seems that double difference was more preferred in that case. Stock price will decrease in 2024 and then increase in consecutive years. 

### Data Management - SQL 
**Description:** The hypothetical magazine subscription company BABA was created to simulate the development of a data product that provides business insights. This project outlines the data product creation process – establishing the business context, designing and implementing an appropriate database schema, generating synthetic data for the database, and creating business insights from the database. <br>
**Code:**<a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Management/Code/Fake%20data%20code.py">
  <code>Faker-code.py</code></a><br>
**Report:** 
  <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Management/Report/Data%20Management_Report.pdf">
  <code>PDF version</code></a><br>
**Original dataset:** Synthetic Data made from faker code <br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation, presentations, SQL <br>
**Hard skills:** MS PowerPoint, SQL, Python: pandas, faker, random <br>
**Results:** This project successfully simulated the development of a comprehensive data product for a subscription-based magazine firm, delivering actionable insights into user behavior, revenue, and engagement. Despite some limitations due to synthetic data and simplified schema, the analysis provides a valuable foundation for strategic, data-driven decisions.

### Treatment Control Testing 
**Description:** This report presents an analysis of the experimental data from an A/B test conducted within the Loan Review Department of a consumer lending company. The experiment aimed to assess whether a newly developed computer model improves loan officers' decision-making accuracy compared to the existing model. <br>
**Code:**<a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Treatment%20control%20testing/Code/Treatment%20control%20testing.html">
  <code>A/B testing.html</code></a><br>
**Report:** 
  <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Treatment%20control%20testing/Report/Treatment%20Control%20Testing%20Report.pdf">
  <code>PDF version</code></a><br>
**Original dataset:** <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Treatment%20control%20testing/Data/Data.csv">
  <code>Testing-data.csv</code></a><br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, A/B testing <br>
**Hard skills:** MS Word, R <br>
**Results:** The results indicate that the new model significantly reduces both Type I and Type II errors, leading to fewer incorrect loan approvals and rejections. To ensure more reliable results, the experiment should continue with an improved design. The control and treatment groups should be balanced, and all loan officers must complete final-stage decisions to maintain consistency. Additionally, a larger dataset is necessary to enhance the statistical power of the experiment.

### Pricing Analytics 
**Description:** This project develops a revenue management solution for BuildMax Rentals to optimise equipment pricing and fleet allocation. Using linear programming and historical rental data, the model aims to maximise revenue while addressing operational constraints and customer demand patterns.<br>
**Code:**<a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pricing%20Analytics/Code.py">
  <code>Pricing-analytics.py</code></a><br>
**Report:** 
  <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pricing%20Analytics/Report.pdf">
  <code>PDF version</code></a><br>
**Original dataset:** <a href = "https://github.com/RishikaAgarwal2025/Business-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Pricing%20Analytics/BuildMax_Rentals_Dataset_Updated.xlsx">
  <code>Pricing-analytics-BuildMax.xlsx</code></a><br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, price analytics, optimisation modelling <br>
**Hard skills:** MS Powerpoint, Python: pyomo <br>
**Results:** Our findings highlight the importance of balancing short-term and long-term rentals, considering sector-specific pricing needs, addressing limited granularity in demand data, issues with maintenance schedules, and the misaligned pricing strategy. Implementing these RM strategies will allow BuildMax to stay competitive, increase revenue potential, and improve overall business performance.

### Analytics in Practice 
**Description:** This project aims to develop a predictive analytics solution for a South American eCommerce platform, Nile, to identify customers likely to leave positive reviews. By building a machine learning model using customer and order data, the goal is to support targeted engagement strategies that efficiently increase positive feedback and enhance the platform’s reputation. <br>

**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, machine learning <br>
**Hard skills:** MS Powerpoint, Python: Decision tree, GBDT, XGBDT, logistic regression, SVM, troubleshooting <br>
**Results:** The gradient boosting model was ultimately selected, however, underprediction and underfitting were discovered. It is advised to enhance the data balance and add a number of features in order to fix this. In virtue of these discoveries, more initiatives will be recommended to improve the model's predictive power.
